As a **Digital Product Designer** and **Front-End Developer** I help clients translate their vision and business goals into interactive digital products through an interdisciplinary understanding of design, development and strategy.

In everything I do, I'm interested in how design and technology can intersect to create the best possible outcome for the user and the business.

## What I Do

My main focus is **digital product design**. I like to fulfil an architect like role, being the translator between the designers intent, the developer's technical implementation, the user's experience and the business' goals.

I create concepts, architect user flows and design interfaces. I lead design teams, setup interdisciplinary workflows, scaled design systems, hold workshops, and coaching and training of your designers.

As a front-end developer I am specialised in creating a responsive and performant experience using HTML, SCSS and Javascript. I'm specialised in CSS, in particular the architecture of css in design systems, browser quirks and performance.
