As a **Digital Product Designer** and **Front-End Developer** I design and develop innovative digital products for the internet in the realm of e-commerce and digital products (SaaS).

In everything I do, I'm interested in how design and technology can intersect to create the best possible outcome for the user and the business.

## What I Do

I collaborate with brands and startups to help them translate their vision and business goals into interactive digital products through an interdisciplinary understanding of design, development and strategy. I lead design teams, setup collaborative workflows, scaled design systems, hold workshops, and coach and train designers.
