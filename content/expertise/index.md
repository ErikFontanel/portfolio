For over 10 years I've been working for clients on digital projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to web applications for start-ups comprising of one or more of the following:

### Design

I approach my design solutions in a hollistic manner. This means that I try understand and question all parts of a project. with others to ask questions, define approaches and execute solutions comprising:

Scaling design systems, component based modular design and. Just like a good car designer has to know how a gearbox works and where it sits, I always design with the constraints and possibilities of the technology in mind.

### Front-end Development

Ever since I built my first website in sixt grade, I've been learning about the latest web technologies. My specialisation is responsive, scalable and performant CSS. Which seems an increasingly rarer skill nowadays. I prefer VueJS when it comes to Javascript frameworks. I know my way around databases and API's and I use the terminal daily.

### Strategy & Leadership

I have a lot of experience working on the agency and client side. I have managed teams, set up design and development workflows, presented for boards of directors and ran my own company.

My skillset makes me a great architect or translator between designers, developers and business. I'm able to discuss with all stakeholders in a project why a certain solution could take five days, while another might take two weeks et vice versa.

- You want more revenue
- You want a better collaboration between your organisation's internal design and development teams
- You have an idea, a budget and a team but don't know where to start
- You want to create a digital product with a great user experience
