Cloom is a start-up offering live group workouts with a real trainer from the comfort of your home. I designed the online fitness experience and set up a design workflow and -system.

Cloom was born during the pandemic, when people resorted to YouTube and Zoom classes for their fitness needs. Cloom offers a tailor made online class room, designed to remove the hassle that comes with Zoom for the trainer and the participants. More information coming soon.
