## HBO

# It's not TV, it's HBO.

In collaboration with with digital agency Tam Tam (now known as [Dept](https://www.deptagency.com/)) we provided HBO with a new website and strategy. In the rapidly changing world of on-demand television, itâ€™s important for a top player like HBO to stand out.

Role: UX Design
Team: Wesley Masius

Taking the legendary pay-off 'It's not TV, it's HBO.' as our starting point, we chose not to explain _what_ HBO is, but _show_ what HBO is. The result is a lean and clear website that uses the unique and premium content available on HBO to sell more subscriptions.

Together with Wesley Masius, we were briefed to translate the general online strategy to a concept and design. We operated like a 'full-stack design duo', doing everything from the overall concept and presentations up until perfecting the last pixels before the hand-off to HBO's own development team. We have presented our concepts and final designs directly twice to HBO in Budapest (including the CEO of HBO Europe). Despite being a though crowd, all of our ideas and designs were instantly approved.

Together we achieved the following:

- decrease in bounce rate
- increase of the number of visitors reaching the subscription form
- decrease of the time visitors need to navigate to the subscription form
- simplified site structure. No dead ends, all navigation paths lead through one funnel to the subscription form
- increase in subscriptions and revenue
