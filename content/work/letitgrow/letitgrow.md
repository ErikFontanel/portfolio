Let It Grow is an an ambitious, internationally oriented innovation platform within the flower- and plant industry developed from Royal FloraHolland. In collaboration with [Vandejong](https://vandejong.com/) I designed their new online magazine journaling the progress of the Let It Grow start-ups and the directory of global green initiatives in a fast paced 5 day design sprint.
