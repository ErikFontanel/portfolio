A replica of a Porsche GT3R race car steering wheel I made. It can used on my sim racing rig with games like Gran Turismo Sport and Assetto Corsa. Designed in Fusion 360 based on reference photographs. The housing and shifters are 3D printed, the plate is laser cut out of a 3mm carbon fiber sheet. The assembly is mounted on a Porsche style steering wheel.

### Materials

- PLA filament
- Carbon fiber
