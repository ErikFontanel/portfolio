Tree-shaped, not T-shaped

Ever since I used a computer at the age of four, I have been captivated by the possibilities. When we got an internet connection at home, it didn't take long to launch my first website (about Pokémon).

For over 10 years I've been working professionally for clients on digital projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to web applications for start-ups.

I founded Fontanel.nl, an online magazine that has grown to be the Dutch creative culture.

Tinkering is in my blood. In my free time I like to work on my own projects. I have a 3D printer and used that to learn CAD (Fusion 360) and some basic electronics. Recently I built a steering wheel replica of a BMW M3 DTM race car and a steering wheel replica of the Porsche GT3R race car.

> ## Hi, I’m Rachael
>
> I’m a specialist _SaaS_ and _B2B_ copywriter on a mission to turn the buttoned-up and boring world of business sales copy into something that speaks to real people -- not demographics.
>
> #### I’m all about copy that delivers personality, persuasion, and profit.
>
> If you're a company with a great product, an understanding of the importance of copywriting for business growth, and you're okay with me using a few too many smiley faces in my emails -- we should talk :-)
> ‍>
> You’ll be pleased to know that:
>
> - **I come equipped with a degree in English**
>   ‍Knowing all the grammar rules means I can BREAK them! Effective copywriting involves pushing the boundaries of what’s “proper”.
>
> - **I’m a qualified paralegal with a background in corporate law**
>   Have you ever had to account for your workdays in 6-minute blocks? I have. After being in legal, project management is a cinch.
>
> - **I’ve worked with a diverse range of companies from digital agencies, to enterprise tech giants, to small startups**
>   I’ve done a lot of research, for a lot of years, for a lot of stuff. And I’m lots of fun at parties. Remind me to tell you how to optimize the bacteria in your silage stacks to keep your cows healthy.

> For over ten years I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with amazing clients—creating custom lettering artwork for established brands, classic books, postage stamps, and so much more. I've travelled the world speaking at creative conferences and colleges, and I've befriend innumerable internet strangers while navigating the depths of social media. I cut my creative teeth in Philadelphia and Brooklyn, but I'm currently based in California where I share a studio with fellow lettering artist Erik Marinovich in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. When I’m not drafting letterforms, manipulating beziers, writing kids books, or letterpressing on my Vandercook, I’m doing my best to help others find the same happiness and fulfillment that I’ve found in my work.
>
> I’ve spoken at more than 100 conferences, colleges, and other design events on nearly every continent. For a complete list of past events and information on upcoming talks, see my Speaking page. To inquire about having me speak at your event, email me.
