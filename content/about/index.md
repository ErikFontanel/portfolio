For the past 15+ years, I’ve worked as a Digital Product Designer and Front-End Developer, helping clients bring ideas to life through a mix of design, development, and strategy. I’ve worked on everything from mobile apps and digital products for startups and corporates to e-commerce platforms and digital experiences. Today, I work freelance with a range of companies and agencies.

I specialise in digital product design, translating vision, technical constraints, business goals, and user needs into clear, functional solutions. I lead design teams, develop design systems, shape user flows, run workshops, and mentor younger designers. I’m involved from first concept through final delivery.

Though my focus is design, I have deep front-end experience, especially in crafting responsive, high-performance interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m well-versed in browser quirks, performance tuning, Linux environments, and version control.

My ideal role is one where I act as a translator between design, technology, and business. I enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams to align vision, implementation, and user experience into cohesive, effective products.
I’ve been fascinated by digital possibilities since I first touched a computer when I was four. By sixth grade, soon after we got internet at home, I had launched my first website. Years later, I founded [Fontanel](/work/fontanel), a side project that grew into one of the Netherlands’ leading platforms for creative talent, events, and jobs.
