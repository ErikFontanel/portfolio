# Future proof e-commerce platform for a direct-to-consumer eyewear company

For the rapidly growing direct-to-consumer eyewear company Ace & Tate I designed their new e-commerce platform. A mobile first user experience supporting the Ace & Tate brand proposition; Affordable and fashionable glasses to go with any outfit and occassion. Helping people buy a product that is normally perceived as a medical device, expensive and cumbersome to buy especially online.

At the end of 2016 I was approached by Mark de Lange, CEO of Ace & Tate. Within just three years after founding the company, they opened two stores in Amsterdam, one in Utrecht and a pop-up in Rotterdam. But as a direct-to-consumer brand, e-commerce plays a vital role in the business model. Their current website couldn't keep up anymore with the chaning company and rapid growth.

Goals:
Everything,
Improved conversion, less friction during checkout
Make the configuring and ordering less complicated
Less load on customer service, reducing questions by informing customers better
Virtual try-on
Better ways of highlighting the products and (seasonal) campaigns
Store finder
Building the brand and offer a place to tell about the collaborations etc

New website:

- Mobile first
- Smooth and rapid configuration
- High resolution product images
- More product information
- More context around product, not just packshot, no white wall of every fucking frame
- Collections, groups, tags, not just filters on properties

Challenges:
Rapid growth, priorities and resources not always clear and changing continiously. With growth comes soul-searching, no clearly defined identity.

Together with my team I achieved the following:

- grew from a team of 1 designer and 2 developers to 3 designers and 6 developers
- set-up a collaborative design workflow using [Abstract](https://getabstract.com) and [Sketch](https://sketch.com)
- designed seasonal campaigns, won a Awwward for the Lernert & Sander campaign
- of which I also did a part of the front-end
- created the overall concept and design of the new online customer experience
- designed the information architecture of the Ace & Tate e-commerce platform and product taxonomies
- designed the UX of the website, including check-out and customer self-service
- concept for the art direction of the new product photography and head shots
