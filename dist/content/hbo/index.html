<h2>HBO</h2>
<h1>It's not TV, it's HBO.</h1>
<p>In collaboration with with digital agency Tam Tam (now known as <a href="https://www.deptagency.com/">Dept</a>) we provided HBO with a new website and strategy. In the rapidly changing world of on-demand television, it’s important for a top player like HBO to stand out.</p>

<p>Taking the legendary pay-off 'It's not TV, it's HBO.' as our starting point, we chose not to explain <em>what</em> HBO is, but <em>show</em> what HBO is. The result is a lean and clear website that uses the unique and premium content available on HBO to sell more subscriptions.</p>

<p>Together with Wesley Masius, we were briefed to translate the general online strategy to a concept and design. We operated like a 'full-stack design duo', doing everything from the overall concept and presentations up until perfecting the last pixels before the hand-off to HBO's own development team. We have presented our concepts and final designs directly twice to HBO in Budapest (including the CEO of HBO Europe). Despite being a though crowd, all of our ideas and designs were instantly approved.</p>
<p>Together we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>decrease in bounce rate</li>
<li>increase of the number of visitors reaching the subscription form</li>
<li>decrease of the time visitors need to navigate to the subscription form</li>
<li>simplified site structure. No dead ends, all navigation paths lead through one funnel to the subscription form</li>
<li>increase in subscriptions and revenue</li>
</ul>
