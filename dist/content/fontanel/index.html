<h2>Fontanel—</h2>
<h1>The platform for dutch creative culture since 2006</h1>
<p>Almost 15 years ago I founded <a href="https://fontanel.nl">Fontanel</a>. Launched in 2006, Fontanel started as a small blog and grew out to become one of the most popular platforms to discover talent, events and jobs in Dutch creative culture. Now Fontanel explores Dutch creative culture and careers, through interviews with leading creatives, a selection of events and helps creatives find a job at a Dutch agency, brand or startup.</p>
<p>Fontanel has been a great way to experiment and learn about interviewing, writing, publishing, code, internet, communities, organising, business, marketing and networking.</p>
<p>Around 2015 I choose to pursue other opportunities outside Fontanel. But it makes me proud that it's still around and independent.</p>
<p>Role: Founder, Designer, Editor, etc.
Team: Thomas Moes, Willem van Roosmalen</p>
