<h2>Hi, I’m Rachael</h2>
<p>I’m a specialist <em>SaaS</em> and <em>B2B</em> copywriter on a mission to turn the buttoned-up and boring world of business sales copy into something that speaks to real people -- not demographics.</p>
<h4>I’m all about copy that delivers personality, persuasion, and profit.</h4>
<p>If you're a company with a great product, an understanding of the importance of copywriting for business growth, and you're okay with me using a few too many smiley faces in my emails -- we should talk :-)
‍&gt;
You’ll be pleased to know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I come equipped with a degree in English</strong>
‍Knowing all the grammar rules means I can BREAK them! Effective copywriting involves pushing the boundaries of what’s “proper”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I’m a qualified paralegal with a background in corporate law</strong>
Have you ever had to account for your workdays in 6-minute blocks? I have. After being in legal, project management is a cinch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I’ve worked with a diverse range of companies from digital agencies, to enterprise tech giants, to small startups</strong>
I’ve done a lot of research, for a lot of years, for a lot of stuff. And I’m lots of fun at parties. Remind me to tell you how to optimize the bacteria in your silage stacks to keep your cows healthy.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>August Winfield Miller</h2>
<p>I am a chronic puzzle-seeker and a lifelong learner. I unpack complicated problems by approaching each with the flexible process and attention it deserves.</p>
<p>This means that I work with others to ask questions, define approaches and execute solutions comprising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Information architecture</li>
<li>User experience &amp; interface design</li>
<li>Visual design</li>
<li>Front- and back-end web development
At the beginning of 2016, I launched oof. with Savannah Julian. We design and develop a special brand of interactive experiences for clients who share our commitment to knowledge and opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a few years prior, I worked with Rumors to help institutions all over the world make better use of the internet. Since November, I helped build the new Emily Books and SCI-Arc sites.</p>
<p>Winter through Spring of 2015, I led interactive design and development courses in the College of Art and Design at Portland State University.</p>
<p>In 2014, I built websites at Instrument while finishing a degree at PSU.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve had the privilege to work with a handful of other technology and design groups.</p>

<p>For over ten years I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with amazing clients—creating custom lettering artwork for established brands, classic books, postage stamps, and so much more. I've travelled the world speaking at creative conferences and colleges, and I've befriend innumerable internet strangers while navigating the depths of social media. I cut my creative teeth in Philadelphia and Brooklyn, but I'm currently based in California where I share a studio with fellow lettering artist Erik Marinovich in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. When I’m not drafting letterforms, manipulating beziers, writing kids books, or letterpressing on my Vandercook, I’m doing my best to help others find the same happiness and fulfillment that I’ve found in my work.</p>
<p>I’ve spoken at more than 100 conferences, colleges, and other design events on nearly every continent. For a complete list of past events and information on upcoming talks, see my Speaking page. To inquire about having me speak at your event, email me.</p>
