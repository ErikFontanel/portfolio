Close is the marketing automation and communication app for event organizers offering hyper-personalised mobile messaging journeys at scale, with the flexibility that event organizers deserve.

I designed the user experience for the web app, established a collaborative design workflow and design system, and contributed directly to the front-end implementation.

Close connects people with events in new and exciting ways; before, during, and after the event. Event attendees receive tickets in the Close app, enhanced by automated, personalized messaging: exclusive content, offers, and live updates. These conversations are powered by automated message flows, triggered by dynamic conditions such as time to event, group size, or attendee responses. Think Instagram Broadcast channels „avant la lettre”.

The web app is the core tool for event organizers. It’s where they manage ticket sales, attendees, upsells, and design their own message flows using an intuitive editor. This web app serves as the operational heart of the platform.

In late 2018, Close had just raised its first funding round and was ready to evolve beyond its MVP. The small but ambitious team needed a product designer who could shape the UX, set up design operations, and bridge design and development to accelerate delivery.

I joined to lead product design for the Close web app, working closely with engineering and product leadership.

During the year and a half-long collaboration, I was responsible for:

- designing the event organizer experience, from concept to full UX
- defining the information architecture for the Close ecosystem
- setting up a collaborative design workflow with [Abstract](https://getabstract.com) and [Sketch](https://sketch.com).
- overseeing front-end implementation with a team of five developers (3 back-end, 1 front-end, 1 tech lead).
- making 338 direct commits to the front-end codebase.
- designing, implementing, and testing component-based UI using [Sketch](https://sketch.com) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) establishing the foundation for a scalable design system.
- helped Close mature from MVP to a scalable SaaS platform ready for growth.
