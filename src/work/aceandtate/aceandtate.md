For the fast-growing direct-to-consumer eyewear company Ace & Tate, I led the design of their new e-commerce platform. A mobile-first shopping experience that embodies the brand’s promise: affordable, fashionable eyewear for every style and any occasion. Helping people buy a product that is normally perceived as a medical device, expensive and cumbersome to buy–especially online.

When I joined in 2016, Ace & Tate was about to expand from two to several retail stores across the Netherlands. As a D2C brand, e-commerce was a crucial growth channel, but their existing website couldn’t scale with the company’s ambitions. CEO Mark de Lange reached out to reimagine their digital experience, one that could support global growth while staying true to the brand’s clean, confident voice.

{% list "Objectives" %}

- Redesign the platform to reflect the Ace & Tate brand and replace the outdated UI.
- Simplify product configuration and reduce friction at checkout.
- Inspire customers through lookbooks, storytelling, and seasonal campaigns.
- Integrate a store finder for new physical locations.
- Strengthen brand recognition and improve conversion rates.

I led design for the complete platform redesign, shaping the concept, architecture, and user experience from end to end. The new site is mobile-first, blending inspiration and utility. Rather than the typical “grid of frames,” we designed context-driven browsing — allowing users to explore by style, release, or occasion instead of static categories. This approach mirrored the in-store experience, where customers discover eyewear that fits their personality, not just a filter set.

We introduced a non-hierarchical way of browsing the collection by not only filtering on properties (gender, color, material) but also tags or taxonomy (style, release, occasion etc). No more 'white wall' filled with every frame in every color, telling the user 'this is all we offer, good luck'.

{% endgallery %}

An experience that not only inspires, but also creates context around the product by using high quality photography of the glasses being worn by people with all types of faces.

  css: 'grid:3'

New high resolution pack shots to showcase the quality of the frames but are also recognisable as Ace & Tate when out of context, ie. shared on platforms like Instagram and Pinterest.

A clear check-out optimised for conversion through a clear, stepped design. The steps are specifically ordered to ask only the absolute necessary information for a transaction as soon as possible so that a sale can be finalised with the help of customer service if necessary.

To support rapid scaling, I established a collaborative design workflow using [Abstract](https://getabstract.com) and [Sketch](https://sketch.com), connecting design and development seamlessly.

We grew the team from one designer and two developers to three designers and six developers, embedding design ops practices that supported the brand’s ongoing digital expansion.
