The Nike Community Experiences Platform empowers Nike Members to discover and participate in exclusive events, from athlete meet-and-greets to workshops and flagship activations.

As Senior Product Designer, I led design for the new platform across web, iOS, and Android, improving event discovery for members and streamlining event management and on-site event hosting for Nike employees.

Leading product design for the new platform across web, iOS, and Android, I collaborated with an international team spanning three continents. My responsibilities included designing the product, conducting user testing, and architecting vendor integrations to ensure a seamless experience for Nike editors and members worldwide. My role combined product design leadership, design engineering, and cross-functional coordination with engineering and marketing teams throughout the organization to align on delivering the best possible consumer experience.

{% list "Objectives" %}

- Redesign event management and discovery within the Nike design system.
- Support a global audience, covering multiple languages and locales.
- Improve accessibility in line with ADA standards.
- Enable frictionless check-ins and reliable on-site experiences.
- Empower Nike marketing teams to create event pages without external developers.

After joining an event, members received a digital ticket for entry. However, poor network connectivity at venues made ticket scanning unreliable, often causing long queues.

To solve this, I worked with engineers to design a dedicated scanning app that cached attendee lists offline, ensuring instant, reliable check-ins, even without a network connection.

Following the successful launch of the CXP platform, Nike’s marketing team used it for large-scale brand moments like the Nike Well Festival and Art of Victory exhibition during the Paris 2024 Olympics.

For these events, I designed dedicated microsites integrated with CXP.  
These pages showcased schedules, ticketing, and artist information — empowering internal teams to create rich event experiences without external agencies.

The Nike Well Festival is a one-of-a-kind, live experience that unites the mind and body through sport, fitness and wellness. Allowing members of the Nike community to experience the future of movement, mindfulness, nutrition, rest and connection with NWC Experts, Trainers, Instructors, and Coaches. IRL and all in one place. Connect with the collective through immersive opportunities that encourages them to reimagine movement and inspire them to pursue a life well lived.

The platform enabled ticketing, live scheduling, and engagement throughout the event.

During the Paris '24 Summer Olympics, Nike partnered with the city’s contemporary art museum Centre Pompidou – the iconic building whose exterior inspired the design of the first Air Max 1 shoe.

The Centre Pompidou gave home to the ‘Art of Victory’ exhibition, showcasing the evolution of Air to look towards the future, telling the story of how Nike helps athletes win. I designed a dedicated micro-site through which people could sign-up for the Art of Victory exhibition and other special events which were announced on the platform.

### Other Work

Beyond the CXP platform, I contributed to several Nike research projects and created a custom Figma plugin to import product data directly from Nike’s internal systems — significantly reducing design team workload and improving workflow efficiency.

{% list "Results" %}

- Reducing costs with a platform that scales across global campaigns and flagship events.
- Increased member sign-ups and event attendance.
- Enabled frictionless check-ins with the offline scanning app.
- Created internal tooling that reduced design team friction.
