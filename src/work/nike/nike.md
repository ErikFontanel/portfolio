The Nike Community Experiences platform empowers members to discover and participate in exclusive events, such as athlete meet-and-greets, workshops, and flagship gatherings. I designed the new platform that simplifies event discovery for consumers and event management and ticketing for Nike employees.

Leading product design for the new platform across web, iOS, and Android, I collaborated with an international team spanning three continents. My responsibilities included designing the product, conducting user testing, and architecting vendor integrations to ensure a seamless experience for Nike editors and members worldwide. I worked closely with stakeholders throughout the organization to align on delivering the best possible consumer experience.

{% list "Objectives" %}

- New design according to the Nike design system.
- Global audience, support for many languages and locales.
- Focus on accessibility according to ADA Accessibility Standards.
- Frictionless on-site experience members and Nike employees
- Improve event discovery and registration for Nike members

After joining an event, each member receives a digital ticket for admission. Previously, connectivity issues at many locations made ticket scanning slow and unreliable, often forcing employees to manually check in members and causing long queues. To solve this, we developed a dedicated scanning app that caches the attendee list offline, enabling fast and seamless check-ins regardless of network reception.

For major Nike moments such as the Nike Well Festival and the Centre Pompidou takeover during the Paris 2024 Olympics, I designed dedicated event pages integrated with the new Community Experiences Platform. These pages showcased event details, schedules, and ticket registration. This new capabilty empowers Nike Marketing teams to create custom event experiences in-house, eliminating the need to hire external agencies for bespoke development.

Another major push has been the user generated content, unlocking ratings & reviews on the PDP.

My work helped transform how Nike members discover and engage with events, strengthening the brand's community-first approach and elevating the digital experience of Nike's global events ecosystem.
