As a **Digital Product Designer** and **Design Engineer**, I help organisations translate their vision and business goals into interactive, scalable digital products.

I work at the intersection of **design, technology, and strategy**, ensuring that ideas not only look great but can also be built, shipped, and maintained efficiently.

In everything I do, I'm driven by how design and technology intersect to create the best possible outcomes for users and the business.

## What I Do

My main focus is **digital product design**. I often act as a bridge between **design and engineering**, translating user needs, design intent, and technical realities into scalable interfaces and component libraries to meet the business' goals and deliver the best user experience.

I create concepts, architect user flows, design interfaces and build the systems that support them. I lead design teams, establish cross-disciplinary workflows, scale design systems, and facilitate workshops, coaching and mentoring designers to work more effectively with engineering.

While my focus is design, I’m hands-on in front-end implementation — building **responsive, accessible, high-performance interfaces** using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue3**, often supported by **Storybook** for documentation and testing.

This technical fluency allows me to prototype quickly, validate ideas early, and ensure a seamless handoff to engineering.

## We Should Work Together If

- You are a start-up ready to scale
- You want tighter collaboration between design and engineering teams.
- You’re building a product that needs to move fast while maintaining quality.
- You have an idea, a budget and a team but don't know where to start
- You value thoughtful, system-driven design that balances usability, scalability, and performance.
