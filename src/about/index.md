For the past 15+ years, I’ve worked as a Digital Product Designer and Design Engineer, helping companies turn ideas into scalable, thoughtful digital products. My work sits at the intersection of **design, technology, and strategy**, balancing aesthetics, usability, and technical feasibility to deliver products that perform, for both users and the business.

I’ve designed and built mobile apps, SaaS platforms, e-commerce experiences, and digital ecosystems for startups and global brands alike. Today, I collaborate with teams and agencies around the world as an independent consultant, focusing on projects that value both craft and systems thinking.

I specialise in digital product design, translating vision, technical constraints, business goals, and user needs into clear, functional solutions. I lead design teams, establish workflows between design and engineering, develop component libraries in Figma and Storybook, shape user flows, run design sprints, and mentor designers to work more effectively across disciplines. I stay involved from concept through final implementation.

Though design is my primary focus, I’m also hands-on in **front-end development**, building responsive, accessible, and high-performance interfaces with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue3**. This technical background allows me to prototype quickly, validate ideas early, and ensure the integrity of design systems as they move into production.

My ideal role is one where I act as the **translator between design, technology, and business**, connecting vision to execution. I thrive in cross-functional teams where design and engineering collaborate closely to ship products that are both elegant and efficient.

I’ve been fascinated by digital possibilities since I first touched a computer when I was four years old. By sixth grade, I had built my first website shortly after getting internet access at home. Years later, I founded [Fontanel](/work/fontanel), a side project that grew into one of the Netherlands’ leading platforms for creative talent, events, and jobs.
